# Serverless Customer Acquisition Platform for Visa

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture designed on **AWS Free Tier** services to scale a promotional campaign for Visa and an E-commerce.

Visa and E-commerce partnered to grow Visa's customer database and drive activation through a $1.99 Gillette kit promotion. During real-time testing, an affiliate leak led to unexpected traffic surges and exposed signup vulnerabilities.

It reimagines a real-world case where a high-profile campaign required a **fraud-resistant**, **secure**, and **scalable** solution to maintain customer data integrity, handle high traffic, and ensure seamless customer engagement.

## 🛠️ Business Challenge

### Before Implementation:
- **High-risk traffic** due to leaked pre-campaign test.
- **Users bypassing purchase limits** by using multiple emails.
- **Absence** of strong identity verification mechanisms.
- **Potential** for legal, financial, and brand reputation risks.
- **Need for scalable, secure architecture** under high demand.

### 🛡️ My Role and Impact
- Identified root vulnerabilities in the customer registration system.
- Led crisis management during the campaign leak, collaborating directly with Visa’s head of marketing.
- Protected the campaign integrity and ensured positive partner relations through proactive communication.
- Designed a **serverless AWS architecture** using Free Tier services.
### Proposed and implemented Solutions:
 - Validate signups with CPF as a unique user identifier.
 - Securely collect sensitive user data (name, email, CPF, card) with account authentication.
 - Enforce a 1-unit-per-customer limit.
 - Handle unexpected traffic via scalable serverless services.
 - Monitor metrics and engage customers post-signup.

### 🏆 After Implementation:
- **41% growth** in Visa/Mastercard customer mailing database.
- **300% organic traffic** in E-commerce’s organic web traffic.
- **24% increase** in e-commerce turnover.
- **5x ROAS** (Return On Ad Spend)achieved.
- **Full fraud prevention** and secure data handling implemented
