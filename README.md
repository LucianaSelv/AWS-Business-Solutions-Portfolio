# üåê AWS Business Solutions Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of **cloud-based business solutions powered by AWS**.
This repository showcases **real-world use cases** from my professional experience, demonstrating how Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be used to solve complex business challenges, optimise operations, and automate processes. 
Each solution is based on actual business cases and is housed in its folder with detailed documentation, architecture diagrams, cost considerations, and implementation strategies. These solutions follow AWS best practices and leverage Free Tier services where applicable.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

- **[Visa Campaign](./visa-campaign/README.md)**: A serverless architecture built to support a high-profile marketing campaign for Visa, designed to handle unexpected traffic spikes, prevent fraud, and scale securely. Utilises services like Amazon Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Pinpoint.

- **[DHL Keycodes](./dhl-keycodes/README.md)**: Automates international shipment documentation to reduce customs delays and manual errors. Uses services such as API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 and more for seamless integration between systems.
